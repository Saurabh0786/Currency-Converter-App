# Currency-Converter-App

# About Project:-
I made a simple currency converter app.
If user input the amount below you have to select one country to another country you want to see the current rate of the country.
If you want exchange rate of that country just clicked the button.
It will show the current rate and If you will change the country it will also see the flag of that country.
